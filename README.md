.NET Core 2.0 Typescript/React/MobxJS boilerplate
========

This is a simple project to get an ASP.NET Core site, using .NET Core, Typescript, React and MobxJS.

## Setup

If you're running VS2017, make sure you have the ASP.NET Core and Node workloads. Open the solution and build it. It should automatically pull down the dependencies from nuget and NPM, run Webpack, and build the solution.

If you're running .NET Core CLI on Windows, Mac, or Linux, make sure you install the .NET Core 2.0+ SDK and node/npm. Then, run the following...

- `cd DotnetTypescript`
- `npm install`
- `dotnet build`
- `dotnet run`
