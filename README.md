.NET Core 1.1 Typescript/React/MobxJS boilerplate
========

This is a simple project to get an ASP.NET Core site, using .NET Core, Typescript, React + ReactJS.NET, and MobxJS, running.

Note: Currently this uses the ReactJS.NET Developer builds, as there are issues running it on .NET Core 1.1 with the (currently released) React.JS 3.0. It's fixed in the newer versions.
